# Mythan
Mythan is a single-threaded Java implementation of the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm as described by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen in 2002 (you can find their paper [here](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf)). 

I started this project out of interest for neural networks. I got inspired by the hundreds of YouTube video's showing very cool applications of NEAT. Instead of using an existing library or external program, I chose to write my own library in Java so I can understand exactly what happens internally when executed. Please note, there are a few performance related things that still have to be done, I am working on that.

# Examples
So far, the only example I've made is a XOR, which you can find in the 'examples' package. I will add more examples soon.

The image below shows a random network generated by Mythan for XOR trained to an error of only 1,25%.
